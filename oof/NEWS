     should lead to cleaner modules
     
   * New telescope "90GBT" which is GBT with aperture diameter set to
     90m (for experimental analysis of MUSTANG data)
     
   * Easier generation of simulated FITS file: oofreduce.genSimFile()
   
   * oofreduce.Red() now returns the directory to which fits were
     output
