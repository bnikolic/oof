The OOF software runs from withing the python interpreter. It can be
used interactively from the standard python command line, from
scripts, or from an IPython command line (although I haven't tested
this).

In order for Python to be able to find the OOF modules, the
environment variable PYTHONPATH needs to be set. Continuing the
previous example, if 

export set BNPREFIX=/home/bnikolic/p/bnprog-devel-main

then PYTHONPATH should be set as 

export set PYTHONPATH="${BNPREFIX}/bin:${BNPREFIX}/lib:${PYTHONPATH}"

It is then just necessary to invoke the python executable (being
careful to use the same one as the libraries were compiled against --
python2.4 in our case) and try :

# Python:
import pyoof
# end Python

If this works then everything else should too.
