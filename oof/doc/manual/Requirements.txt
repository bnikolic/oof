Required compilers:

* C, C++ and Fortran compilers are required. It appears that gfortran
  4.1 *does not work*, so g77 is required.

Pre-required packages for the OOF holography software:

* Python 2.4

* FFTW v.2 

  ** Note that FFTW v.3 is *not* compatible with FFTW2 and will not
     work in place of FFTW v.2. It should however be possible to have
     both installed on the system if required.

* SWIG 1.3.31 or later

* PGPLOT

* GSL V 1.6 or later

* Boost C++ libraries v. 1.30.0 or later

* CFitsIO
