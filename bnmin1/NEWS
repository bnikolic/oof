BNMin1 Release Notes  
======================

Version 1.5
===========

Enhancements:

  * fSaveChain is now more flexible and can add keywords to the FITS
    file and take both raw chains and chains as numpy arrays

Building:

  * Boost configure script is now better and finding the correct
    libraries


Version 1.4
===========

New features:

  * Class for Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno minimisation, binding
    to the GSL implementation

Enhancements:

  * Class for specifying log-flat priors (Minim::LogFlatPriors)

  * New parameter utility functions in bnmin1utils.py

Bug-fixes:

  * Likelihood calculation from square of residuals now correctly
    takes into account a factor of two arising from standard gaussian
    noise likelihood calculation

  * ParamCtr constructor signature rationalised to not copy the name
    parameter. Unlikely to cause problems, but noted here for
    completeness.

  * PrettyPrint did not conform to new BOOST version... disabled for
    the time being

Building:

  * Support for the new gfortran compilers

  * (Late update to notes) Requires GSL 1.9 because of the BFGSv2
    algorithm

Distribution:

  * To be sent to ESO & published on web-site

Version 1.3
===========

   BUG FIXES:
   
   * fSaveChain correctly names the table columns

   NEW FEATURES:
   
   * Metropolis sampling can displace each parameter in turn (see
     option Minim::MetropolisMCMC::Sequence)
     
   * Experimental flat priors for MCMC (see
     Minim::IndependentFlatPriors)
   
   ENHANCEMENT:
