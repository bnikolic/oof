BNMin1 Release Notes  
======================

Version 1.11
============

New features:

* Function to marginalise the nested sampler posterior to two
  dimension, allowing easy visualisation of joint probabilities of two
  parameters (marginHist2D)

Improvements:

Bug fixes:
 

Version 1.10
============

New features:

* Higher-level Python wrappings of the Nested Sampling routines in
  pybind/bin/bnmin1nested.py

* Baeysian line-fitting (apps/bayesline.hxx)

Building:

* Can disable compiling and use of the PDA algorithms -- useful for
  systems without a functioning F77 (obviously, some algorithms rely
  on this so they will not work!). Use the --disable-pda swithc to
  configure

* Can disable configuration and building of the tests. Useful for
  problematic boost installations since the test programs use compiled
  boost libraries

Version 1.9
===========

Improvements:

* Improvement to accuracy of the nested sampler

Build improvements:

* Can disable the building of the python binding by calling configure
  as:

  ./configure --disable-pybind

  This removes the dependency on SWIG

Version 1.8
===========

Improvements:

* Run-time-configurable strategy for picking the starting point for
  nested sampling (src/nestedinitial.hxx)

* Functions to calculate histogrammed probability distributions (1-d
  and n-d) from nested sampling distributions (src/mcpoint.hxx)

Bug-fixes:

* Another bug-fix for handling of fixed (i.e., non-minimised)
  parameters when using nested sampling

Build:

* New check version of SWIG to work around old installations. Requires
  version 1.3.31 at least


Version 1.7
===========

Bug-fixes:

* Correct building of the test programs from tar-balls

Improvements:

* Better prior sampling in the prototype nested sampling routines

New features:

* Start a new "apps" subdirectory with illustrative & useful examples
  of problems to solve. 


Version 1.6
===========

New features:

  * Prototype Nested Sampling implementation. See "nestedsampler.hxx"

  * Computation of best-fitting lines to data with errors in booth of
    the coordinates. See "twoerrline.hxx"

Bug-fixes:

  * RobustLineObsMod constructor now takes parameters as
    const-references

Version 1.5
===========

Enhancements:

  * fSaveChain is now more flexible and can add keywords to the FITS
    file and take both raw chains and chains as numpy arrays

Building:

  * Boost configure script is now better and finding the correct
    libraries


Version 1.4
===========

New features:

  * Class for Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno minimisation, binding
    to the GSL implementation

Enhancements:

  * Class for specifying log-flat priors (Minim::LogFlatPriors)

  * New parameter utility functions in bnmin1utils.py

Bug-fixes:

  * Likelihood calculation from square of residuals now correctly
    takes into account a factor of two arising from standard gaussian
    noise likelihood calculation

  * ParamCtr constructor signature rationalised to not copy the name
    parameter. Unlikely to cause problems, but noted here for
    completeness.

  * PrettyPrint did not conform to new BOOST version... disabled for
    the time being

Building:

  * Support for the new gfortran compilers

  * (Late update to notes) Requires GSL 1.9 because of the BFGSv2
    algorithm

Distribution:

  * To be sent to ESO & published on web-site

Version 1.3
===========

   BUG FIXES:
   
   * fSaveChain correctly names the table columns

   NEW FEATURES:
   
   * Metropolis sampling can displace each parameter in turn (see
     option Minim::MetropolisMCMC::Sequence)
     
   * Experimental flat priors for MCMC (see
     Minim::IndependentFlatPriors)
   
   ENHANCEMENT:
   

   DISTRIBUTION:

   * Posted on the web

Version 1.2
===========

   BUG FIXES:

   NEW FEATURES:
   
   * C++ unit tests (see test directory)
   
   * Metropolis sampling (see metropolis.hxx)

   ENHANCEMENT:
   
   * Can report version of the library through Minim::version() call
   
   * Prodcues a pkg-config file

   DISTRIBUTION:
   
   * Sent to ESO as part of ALMA WVR FP6 work

Version 1.1
===========

Version 1.0
===========

   DISTRIBUTION:
   
   * Publicly circulated to various projects (oof: NRAO, MPIfR)
