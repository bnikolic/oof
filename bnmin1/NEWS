======================

Version 1.4
===========

New features:

  * Class for specifying log-flat priors (Minim::LogFlatPriors)

  * New parameter utility functions in bnmin1utils.py

Bug-fixes:

  * Likelihood calculation from square of residuals now correctly
    takes into account a factor of two arising from standard gaussian
    noise likelihood calculation

  * ParamCtr constructor signature rationalised to not copy the name

    completeness.

  * PrettyPrint did not conform to new BOOST version... disabled for
