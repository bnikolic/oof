BNMin1 ReadMe File
==================

BNMin1 is a minimisation libray. Please see
http://www.mrao.cam.ac.uk/~bn204/oof/bnmin1.html for more information.

Building
--------

There are two build systems shipped with BNMin1: AutoTools-based build
system and a CMake-based system. It is strongly recommended to _only_
use the AutoTools unless you have a very specefic reason to use CMake
(such as embedding into a CMake based project).

For basic build use command:

  ./configure --prefix=<destination> 
  make && make install
