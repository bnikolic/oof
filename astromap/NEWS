AstroMap Release Notes
======================

Version 1.5
-----------

Enhancements:

* Convolution function now can store the result in a separate map (see
  src/convolve.hxx)

Version 1.4
-----------

Enhancements:

* FFT is now implemented using FFTW3 , which should provide
  significant performance gain

* Preliminary support for map regions

* Corrections to the convolution function

* Preliminary support for reading coordinate systems with CR*
  variables


Version 1.3
-----------

Enhancements:

  * In python maps can copy themselves to plain std::vector and
    return. Therefore can do::
     
      numpy.array(m.vect())

  * Indexing errors in map interpolation are caught in python wrap and
    do not cause an abort of the program

Building:

  * In order to migrate fully to pkg-config conditional compilation of
    fitting codes has become mandatory for the time beeing. Please
    ensure BNMin1 is in the pkg-config path

  * Support for the news GNU toolchain (gcc 4.3, gfortran, etc)

  * Upgrade to BOOST configuration macros to speed up configuration
    and hopefully make more reliable

To be Version 1.2.1
