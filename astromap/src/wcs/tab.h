*   WCSLIB 4.0 - C routines that implement tabular coordinate systems as
*   defined by the FITS World Coordinate System (WCS) standard.  Refer to
*
*      "Representations of world coordinates in FITS",
*      Greisen, E.W., & Calabretta, M.R. 2002, A&A, 395, 1061 (paper I)

*      (paper III, in preparation)
*
*
*   Summary of routines
*   -------------------
*   These routines implement the part of the FITS WCS standard that deals with
*   tabular coordinates, i.e. coordinates that are defined via a lookup table.
*   They define methods to be used for computing tabular world coordinates
*   from intermediate world coordinates (a linear transformation of image
*   pixel coordinates), and vice versa.  They are based on the tabprm struct,
*   described in detail below, which contains all information needed for the
*   computations.  The struct contains some members that must be set by the
*   caller, and others that are maintained by these routines, somewhat like a
*   C++ class but with no encapsulation.
*
*   Three service routines, tabini(), tabcpy(), and tabfree() are provided to
*   manage the tabprm struct, and another, tabprt(), to print its contents.
*
*   A setup routine, tabset(), computes intermediate values in the tabprm
*   struct from parameters in it that were supplied by the caller.  The
*   struct always needs to be set up by tabset() but it need not be called
*   explicitly - see the explanation of tab.flag below.
*
*   tabx2s() and tabs2x() implement the WCS tabular coordinate
*   transformations.
*
*
*   Default constructor for the tabprm struct; tabini()
*   ---------------------------------------------------
*   tabini() allocates memory for arrays in a tabprm struct and sets all
*   members of the struct to default values.
*
*   Given:
*      alloc    int      If true, allocate memory for arrays in the tabprm
*                        struct (see "Memory allocation and deallocation
*                        below").  Otherwise, it is assumed that pointers to
*                        these arrays have been set by the caller except if
*                        they are null pointers in which case memory will be
*                        allocated for them regardless.  (In other words,
*                        setting alloc true saves having to initalize these
*                        pointers to zero.)
*
*      M        int      The number of tabular coordinate axes.
*      K        const int[]
*                        Vector of length M whose elements (K_1, K_2,... K_M)
*                        record the lengths of the axes of the coordinate
*                        array and of each indexing vector.  M and K[] are
*                        used to determine the length of the various tabprm
*                        arrays and therefore the amount of memory to allocate
*                        for them.
*
*   Given and returned:
*      tab      struct tabprm*
*                        Tabular transformation parameters (see below).
*                        Note that, in order to initialize memory management
*                        tab->flag should be set to -1 when tab is initialized
*                        for the first time (memory leaks may result if it had
*                        already been initialized).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null tabprm pointer passed.
*                           2: Memory allocation failed.
*                           3: Invalid tabular parameters.
*
*
*   Copy routine for the tabprm struct; tabcpy()
*   --------------------------------------------
*   tabcpy() does a deep copy of one tabprm struct to another, using tabini()
*   to allocate memory for its arrays if required.  Only the "information to
*   be provided" part of the struct is copied; a call to tabset() is required
*   to set up the remainder.
*
*   Given:
*      alloc    int      If true, allocate memory for the crpix, pc, and cdelt
*                        arrays in the destination.  Otherwise, it is assumed
*                        that pointers to these arrays have been set by the
*                        caller except if they are null pointers in which case
*                        memory will be allocated for them regardless.
*      tabsrc   const struct tabprm*
*                        Struct to copy from.
*
*   Given and returned:
*      tabdst   struct tabprm*
*                        Struct to copy to.  tabdst->flag should be set to -1
*                        if tabdst was not previously initialized (memory
*                        leaks may result if it was previously initialized).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null tabprm pointer passed.
*                           2: Memory allocation failed.
*
*
*   Destructor for the tabprm struct; tabfree()
*   -------------------------------------------
*   tabfree() frees memory allocated for the tabprm arrays by tabini().
*   tabini() records the memory it allocates and tabfree() will only attempt
*   to free this.
*
*   Returned:
*      tab      struct tabprm*
*                        Coordinate transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null tabprm pointer passed.
*
*
*   Print routine for the tabprm struct; tabprt()
*   ---------------------------------------------
*   tabprt() prints the contents of a tabprm struct.
*
*   Given:
*      tab      const struct tabprm*
*                        Tabular transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null tabprm pointer passed.
*
*
*   Set up routine; tabset()
*   ------------------------
*   tabset() allocates memory for work arrays in the tabprm struct and sets up
*   the struct according to information supplied within it (see "Tabular
*   transformation parameters" below).
*
*   Note that this routine need not be called directly; it will be invoked by
*   tabx2s() and tabs2x() if the "flag" struct member is anything other than a
*   predefined magic value.
*
*   Given and returned:
*      tab      struct tabprm*
*                        Tabular transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null tabprm pointer passed.
*                           3: Invalid tabular parameters.
*
*
*   Pixel-to-world transformation; tabx2s()
*   ---------------------------------------
*   tabx2s() transforms intermediate world coordinates to world coordinates
*   using coordinate lookup.
*
*   Given and returned:
*      tab      struct tabprm*
*                        Tabular transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Given:
*      ncoord   int      The number of coordinates, each of vector length
*      nelem    int      nelem.
*      x        const double[ncoord][nelem]
*                        Array of intermediate world coordinates, SI units.
*
*   Returned:
*      world    double[ncoord][nelem]
*                        Array of world coordinates, in SI units.
*      stat     int[ncoord]
*                        Status return value status for each coordinate:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Invalid intermediate world coordinate.
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null tabprm pointer passed.
*                           3: Invalid tabular parameters.
*                           4: One or more of the x coordinates were invalid,
*                              as indicated by the stat vector.
*
*
*   World-to-pixel transformation; tabs2x()
*   ---------------------------------------
*   tabs2x() transforms world coordinates to intermediate world coordinates.
*
*   Given and returned:
*      tab      struct tabprm*
*                        Tabular transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Given:
*      ncoord   int      The number of coordinates, each of vector length
*      nelem    int      nelem.
*      world    const double[ncoord][nelem]
*                        Array of world coordinates, in SI units.
*
*   Returned:
*      x        double[ncoord][nelem]
*                        Array of intermediate world coordinates, SI units.
*      stat     int[ncoord]
*                        Status return value status for each vector element:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Invalid world coordinate.
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null tabprm pointer passed.
*                           3: Invalid tabular parameters.
*                           5: One or more of the world coordinates were
*                              invalid, as indicated by the stat vector.
*
*
*   Tabular transformation parameters
*   ----------------------------------
*   The tabprm struct consists of the following elements that must be
*   supplied:
*
*      int flag
*         This flag must be set to zero whenever any of the following tabprm
*         structure members are set or changed.  This signals the
*         initialization routine, tabset(), to recompute intermediaries.
*
*      int M
*         Number of tabular coordinate axes.
*
*      int *K
*         Pointer to the first element of a vector of length M whose elements
*         (K_1, K_2,... K_M) record the lengths of the axes of the coordinate
*         array and of each indexing vector.
*
*      int *map
*         Pointer to the first element of a vector of length M that defines
*         the association between axis m in the M-dimensional coordinate array
*         (1 <= m <= M) and the indices of the intermediate world coordinate
*         and world coordinate arrays, x[] and world[], in the argument lists
*         for tabx2s() and tabs2x().
*
*         When x[] and world[] contain the full complement of coordinate
*         elements in image-order, as will usually be the case, then
*         map[m-1] == i-1 for axis i in the N-dimensional image (1 <= i <= N).
*         In terms of the FITS keywords
*
*            map[PVi_3a - 1] == i - 1.
*
*         However, a different association may result if x[], for example,
*         only contains a (relevant) subset of intermediate world coordinate
*         elements.  For example, if M == 1 for an image with N > 1, it is
*         possible to fill x[] with the relevant coordinate element with nelem
*         set to 1.  In this case map[0] = 0 regardless of the value of i.
*
*      double *crval
*         Pointer to the first element of a vector of length M whose elements
*         contain the index value for the reference pixel for each of the
*         tabular coordinate axes.
*
*      double **index
*         Pointer to the first element of a vector of length M of pointers to
*         vectors of lengths (K_1, K_2,... K_M) of 0-relative indexes.
*
*      double *coord
*         Pointer to the first element of the tabular coordinate array,
*         treated as though it were defined as
*
*            double coord[K_M]...[K_2][K_1][M]
*
*         i.e. with the M dimension varying fastest so that the M elements of
*         a coordinate vector are stored contiguously in memory.
*
*   The remaining members of the tabprm struct are maintained by tabset() and
*   must not be modified elsewhere:
*
*      int nc
*         Total number of coordinate vectors in the coordinate array being the
*         product of K_1 * K_2 * ... * K_M.
*
*      int *sense
*         Pointer to the first element of a vector of length M whose elements
*         indicate whether the corresponding indexing vector is monotonic
*         increasing (+1), or decreasing (-1).
*
*      double *p0, *delta
*         Pointer to the first element of a vector of length M of interpolated
*         indices into the coordinate array such that Upsilon[m], as defined
*         in Paper III, is equal to p0[m] + delta[m].
*
*      double *extrema
*         Pointer to the first element of an array that records the minimum
*         and maximum value of each element of the coordinate vector in each
*         row of the coordinate array, treated as though it were defined as
*
*            double extrema[K_M]...[K_2][2][M]
*
*         The minimum is recorded in the first element of the compressed K_1 
*         dimension, then the maximum.  This array is used by the inverse
*         table lookup function, tabs2x(), to speed up table searches.
*
*
*   Vector arguments
*   ----------------
*   Arrays of intermediate world coordinates and world coordinates are two
*   dimensional, i.e. x[ncoord][nelem].
*
*   Note that the function prototypes must declare two-dimensional arrays as
*   one-dimensional to avoid compiler warnings about declaration of
*   "incomplete types".  This was considered preferable to declaring them as
*   simple pointers-to-double which gives no indication that storage is
*   associated with them.
*
*
*   Memory allocation and deallocation
*   ----------------------------------
*   tabini() allocates memory for the K, map, crval, index, and coord arrays
*   (including the arrays referenced by index[]) in the tabprm struct.  It is
*   provided as a service routine; usage is optional, and the caller is at
*   liberty to set these pointers independently.
*
*   tabset() also allocates memory for the minmax, sense, p0, and delta
*   arrays.  The caller must not modify these.
*
*   tabini() maintains a record of memory it has allocated and this is used
*   by tabfree() which tabini() uses to free any memory that it may have
*   allocated on a previous invokation.  Thus it is not necessary for the
*   caller to invoke tabfree() separately if tabini() is invoked repeatedly on
*   the same tabprm struct.  Likewise, tabset() deallocates memory that it
*   may have allocated in the same tabprm struct on a previous invokation.
*
*   However, a memory leak will result if a tabprm struct goes out of scope
*   before the memory has been free'd, either by tabfree() or otherwise.
*   Likewise, if the tabprm struct itself has been malloc'd and the allocated
*   memory is not free'd when the memory for the struct is free'd.  A leak may
*   also arise if the caller interferes with the array pointers in the
*   "private" part of the tabprm struct.
*
*   Beware of making a shallow copy of a tabprm struct by assignment; any
*   changes made to allocated memory in one would be reflected in the other,
*   and if the memory allocated for one was free'd the other would reference
*   unallocated memory.  Use tabcpy() instead to make a deep copy.
*
*
*   Status return values
*   --------------------
*   Error messages to match the status value returned from each function are
*   are encoded in the tab_errmsg character array.
*
*
*   Accuracy
*   --------
*   No warranty is given for the accuracy of these routines (refer to the
*   copyright notice above); intending users must satisfy for themselves their
*   adequacy for the intended purpose.  However, closure effectively to within
*   double precision rounding error was demonstrated by test routine ttab.c
*   which accompanies this software.
