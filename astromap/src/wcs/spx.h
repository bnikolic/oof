*   WCSLIB 4.0 - C routines that implement the spectral coordinate systems
*   recognized by the FITS World Coordinate System (WCS) standard.  Refer to
*

*
*   Summary of routines
*   -------------------
*      specx() is a scalar routine that, given one spectral variable (e.g.
*      frequency), computes all the others (e.g. wavelength, velocity, etc.)
*      plus the required derivatives of each with respect to the others.  The
*      results are returned in the spxprm struct, described in detail below.
*
*      The remaining routines are all vector conversions from one spectral
*      variable to another.  Conversion may be done "in place" by calling
*      the routine with the output vector set to the input.
*
*      Logarithmic conversions
*      ------------------------
*      speclog()    Converts spectral values to their natural logarithm
*      logspec()    Restores spectral values from their natural logarithm
*
*      Non-linear   From                    To

*
*   Spectral cross conversions (scalar); specx()
*   --------------------------------------------
*   Given one spectral variable specx() computes all the others, plus the
*   required derivatives of each with respect to the others.
*
*   Given:
*      type     const char*
*                        The type of spectral variable given by spec, FREQ,
*                        AFRQ, ENER, WAVN, VRAD, WAVE, VOPT, ZOPT, AWAV, VELO,
*                        or BETA (case sensitive).
*      spec     double   The spectral variable given, in SI units.
*      restfrq  double   Rest frequency (Hz) or rest wavelength in vacuum (m),
*      restwav  double   only one of which need be given.  The other should be
*                        set to zero.  If both are zero, only a subset of the
*                        spectral variables can be computed, the remainder
*                        are set to zero.  Specifically, given one of FREQ,
*                        AFRQ, ENER, WAVN, WAVE, or AWAV the others can be
*                        computed without knowledge of the rest frequency.
*                        Likewise, VRAD, VOPT, ZOPT, VELO, and BETA.
*
*   Given and returned:
*      specs    struct spxprm*
*                        Data structure defined below containing all spectral
*                        variables and their derivatives, in SI units.
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null spxprm pointer passed.

*      outstep  int      Vector strides, see below.
*      inspec   const double[]
*                        Input spectral variables, in SI units.
*
*   Returned:
*      outspec  double[] Output spectral variables, in SI units.
*      stat     int[]    Status return value for each vector element:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Invalid value of inspec.
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:

*                           2: Invalid spectral parameters.
*                           4: One or more of the inspec coordinates were
*                              invalid, as indicated by the stat vector.
*
*
*   Spectral conversions (vector); freqwave(), wavefreq(), etc.
*   -----------------------------------------------------------
*   Vector conversions from one spectral variable to another.  These are the
*   workhorse routines to be used for fast transformations.
*
*   Given:
*      param    double   1) Rest frequency (Hz) when the conversion is between
*                           frequency and any type of velocity, i.e.
*                              freqvelo(), velofreq(),
*                              freqvrad(), vradfreq().
*
*                        2) Rest wavelength in vacuum (m) when the conversion
*                           is between vacuum or air wavelength and any type
*                           of velocity, i.e.
*                              wavevelo(), velowave(),
*                              awavvelo(), veloawav(),
*                              wavevopt(), voptwave(),
*                              wavezopt(), zoptwave().
*
*                        3) Ignored otherwise, i.e.
*                              freqwave(), wavefreq(),
*                              freqawav(), awavfreq(),
*                              waveawav(), awavwave(),
*                              freqafrq(), afrqfreq(),
*                              freqener(), enerfreq(),
*                              freqwavn(), wavnfreq(),
*                              velobeta(), betavelo().
*
*      nspec    int      Vector length, see below.
*      instep   int
*      outstep  int      Vector strides, see below.
*      inspec   const double[]
*                        Input spectral variables, in SI units.
*
*   Returned:
*      outspec  double[] Output spectral variables, in SI units.
*      stat     int[]    Status return value for each vector element:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Invalid value of inspec.
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           2: Invalid spectral parameters.
*                           4: One or more of the inspec coordinates were
*                              invalid, as indicated by the stat vector.
*
*
*   Vector lengths and strides
*   --------------------------
*   Vector computation in the spectral code mainly speeds it by amortising the
*   function call overhead.  The vector length function argument refers to the
*   number of spectral variables in both the input and output spectral
*   vectors.
*
*   The vector stride arguments allow the caller to specify that successive
*   elements of a vector are not contiguous in memory.  This applies equally
*   to vectors given to, or returned from a function.  As a simple example
*   consider the following two arrangements in memory of a spectral vector
*   s[], with four elements, s1, s2, s3, and s4, together with x[] and y[]
*   vectors:
*
*      1) s1 s2 s3 s4 x1 x2 x3 x4 y1 y2 y3 y4
*
*      2) x1 y1 s1 x2 y2 s2 x3 y3 s3 x4 y4 s4
*
*   In (1), the address of s[] is s1, its stride is 1, and length 4.
*   In (2), the address of s[] is s1, its stride is 3, and length 4.
*
*   If the vector length is 1 then the stride is ignored and may be set to 0.
*
*
*   Status return values
*   --------------------
*   Error messages to match the status value returned from each function are
*   are encoded in the spx_errmsg character array.
*
*
*   Argument checking
*   -----------------
*   The input spectral values are only checked for values that would result
*   in floating point exceptions.  In particular, negative frequencies and
*   wavelengths are allowed, as are velocities greater than the speed of
*   light.  The same is true for the spectral parameters - rest frequency and
*   wavelength.
*
*
*   Accuracy
*   --------
*   No warranty is given for the accuracy of these routines (refer to the
*   copyright notice above); intending users must satisfy for themselves their
*   adequacy for the intended purpose.  However, closure effectively to within
*   double precision rounding error was demonstrated by test routine tspec.c
*   which accompanies this software.
