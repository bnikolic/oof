*   WCSLIB 4.0 - C routines that implement the FITS World Coordinate System
*   (WCS) standard.  Refer to
*
*      "Representations of world coordinates in FITS",
*      Greisen, E.W., & Calabretta, M.R. 2002, A&A, 395, 1061 (paper I)
*
*
*   Summary of routines
*   -------------------
*   These routines apply the linear transformation defined by the FITS WCS
*   standard.  They are based on the linprm struct, described in detail
*   below, which contains all information needed for the computations.  The
*   struct contains some members that must be set by the caller, and others
*   that are maintained by these routines, somewhat like a C++ class but with
*   no encapsulation.
*
*   Three service routines, linini(), lincpy(), and linfree() are provided to
*   manage the linprm struct, and another, linprt(), prints its contents.
*
*   A setup routine, linset(), computes intermediate values in the linprm
*   struct from parameters in it that were supplied by the caller.  The struct
*   always needs to be set up by linset() but need not be called explicitly -
*   see the explanation of lin.flag below.
*
*   linp2s() and lins2p() implement the WCS linear transformations.
*
*   An auxiliary matrix inversion routine, matinv(), is included.  It uses
*   LU-triangular factorization with scaled partial pivoting.
*
*
*   Default constructor for the linprm struct; linini()
*   ---------------------------------------------------
*   linini() allocates memory for arrays in a tabprm struct and sets all
*   members of the struct to default values.
*
*   Given:
*      alloc    int      If true, allocate memory for arrays in the tabprm
*                        struct (see "Memory allocation and deallocation
*                        below").  Otherwise, it is assumed that pointers to
*                        these arrays have been set by the caller except if
*                        they are null pointers in which case memory will be
*                        allocated for them regardless.  (In other words,
*                        setting alloc true saves having to initalize these
*                        pointers to zero.)
*
*      naxis    int      The number of world coordinate axes, used to
*                        determine array sizes.
*
*   Given and returned:
*      lin      struct linprm*
*                        Linear transformation parameters (see below).
*                        Note that, in order to initialize memory management
*                        lin->flag should be set to -1 when lin is initialized
*                        for the first time (memory leaks may result if it had
*                        already been initialized).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null linprm pointer passed.
*                           2: Memory allocation failed.
*
*
*   Copy routine for the linprm struct; lincpy()
*   --------------------------------------------
*   lincpy() does a deep copy of one linprm struct to another, using linini()
*   to allocate memory for its arrays if required.  Only the "information to
*   be provided" part of the struct is copied; a call to linset() is required
*   to initialize the remainder.
*
*   Given:
*      alloc    int      If true, allocate memory for the crpix, pc, and cdelt
*                        arrays in the destination.  Otherwise, it is assumed
*                        that pointers to these arrays have been set by the
*                        caller except if they are null pointers in which case
*                        memory will be allocated for them regardless.
*      linsrc   const struct linprm*
*                        Struct to copy from.
*
*   Given and returned:
*      lindst   struct linprm*
*                        Struct to copy to.  lindst->flag should be set to -1
*                        if lindst was not previously initialized (memory
*                        leaks may result if it was previously initialized).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null linprm pointer passed.
*                           2: Memory allocation failed.
*
*
*   Destructor for the linprm struct; linfree()
*   -------------------------------------------
*   linfree() frees memory allocated for the linprm arrays by linini() and/or
*   linset().  linini() keeps a record of the memory it allocates and
*   linfree() will only attempt to free this.
*
*   Given:
*      lin      struct linprm*
*                        Linear transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null linprm pointer passed.
*
*
*   Print routine for the linprm struct; linprt()
*   ---------------------------------------------
*   linprt() prints the contents of a linprm struct.
*
*   Given:
*      lin      const struct linprm*
*                        Linear transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null linprm pointer passed.
*
*
*   Setup routine; linset()
*   -----------------------
*   linset(), if necessary, allocates memory for the piximg and imgpix arrays
*   in the linprm struct and sets up the struct according to information
*   supplied within it (see "Linear transformation parameters" below).
*
*   Note that this routine need not be called directly; it will be invoked by
*   linp2x() and linx2p() if the "flag" struct member is anything other than a
*   predefined magic value.
*
*   Given and/or returned:
*      lin      struct linprm*
*                        Linear transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null linprm pointer passed.
*                           2: Memory allocation failed.
*                           3: PCi_ja matrix is singular.
*
*
*   Pixel-to-world transformation; linp2x()
*   ---------------------------------------
*   linp2x() transforms pixel coordinates to intermediate world coordinates.
*
*   Given and/or returned:
*      lin      struct linprm*
*                        Linear transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Given:
*      ncoord   int      The number of coordinates, each of vector length
*      nelem    int      nelem but containing lin.naxis coordinate elements.
*      pixcrd   const double[ncoord][nelem]
*                        Array of pixel coordinates.
*
*   Returned:
*      imgcrd   double[ncoord][nelem]
*                        Array of intermediate world coordinates.
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null linprm pointer passed.
*                           2: Memory allocation failed.
*                           3: PCi_ja matrix is singular.
*
*
*   World-to-pixel transformation; linx2p()
*   ---------------------------------------
*   linx2p() transforms intermediate world coordinates to pixel coordinates.
*
*   Given and returned:
*      lin      struct linprm*
*                        Linear transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Given:
*      ncoord   int      The number of coordinates, each of vector length
*      nelem    int      nelem but containing lin.naxis coordinate elements.
*      imgcrd   const double[ncoord][nelem]
*                        Array of intermediate world coordinates.
*
*   Returned:
*      pixcrd   double[ncoord][nelem]
*                        Array of pixel coordinates.
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null linprm pointer passed.
*                           2: Memory allocation failed.
*                           3: PCi_ja matrix is singular.
*
*
*   Linear transformation parameters
*   --------------------------------
*   The linprm struct consists of the following elements that must be
*   supplied:
*
*      int flag
*         This flag must be set to zero whenever any of the following members
*         of the linprm struct are set or modified.  This signals the
*         initialization routine, linset(), to recompute intermediaries.
*
*         flag should be set to -1 when linini() is called for the first time
*         for a linprm struct in order to initialize memory management.  It
*         must ONLY be used on the first initialization otherwise memory leaks
*         may result.
*
*      int naxis
*         Number of pixel and world coordinate elements.
*
*      double *crpix
*         Pointer to the first element of an array of double containing the
*         coordinate reference pixel, CRPIXja.
*
*      double *pc
*         Pointer to the first element of the PCi_ja (pixel coordinate)
*         transformation matrix.  The expected order is
*
*            lin.pc = {PC1_1, PC1_2, PC2_1, PC2_2};
*
*         This may be constructed conveniently from a two-dimensional array
*         via
*
*            double m[2][2] = {{PC1_1, PC1_2},
*                              {PC2_1, PC2_2}};
*
*         which is equivalent to,
*
*            double m[2][2];
*            m[0][0] = PC1_1;
*            m[0][1] = PC1_2;
*            m[1][0] = PC2_1;
*            m[1][1] = PC2_2;
*
*         for which the storage order is
*
*            PC1_1, PC1_2, PC2_1, PC2_2
*
*         so it would be legitimate to set lin.pc = *m.
*
*      double *cdelt
*         Pointer to the first element of an array of double containing the
*         coordinate increments, CDELTia.
*
*   The remaining members of the linprm struct are maintained by linset() and
*   must not be modified elsewhere:
*
*      int unity
*         True if the linear transformation matrix is unity.
*
*      double *piximg
*         Pointer to the first element of the matrix containing the product
*         of the CDELTia diagonal matrix and the PCi_ja matrix.
*
*      double *imgpix
*         Pointer to the first element of the inverse of the piximg matrix.
*
*      int m_flag, m_naxis
*      double *m_crpix, *m_pc, *m_cdelt
*         These are used for memory management by linini() and linfree().
*
*
*   Vector arguments
*   ----------------
*   Arrays of pixel and world coordinates are two dimensional, i.e.
*   pixcrd[ncoord][nelem], where nelem must equal or exceed the number of
*   coordinate elements, naxis, stored in the linprm struct.  Exception: when
*   ncoord == 1, nelem is not used.
*
*   Note that the function prototypes must declare two-dimensional arrays as
*   one-dimensional to avoid warnings about declaration of "incomplete types".
*   This was considered preferable to declaring them as simple
*   pointers-to-double which gives no indication that storage is associated
*   with them.
*
*
*   Memory allocation and deallocation
*   ----------------------------------
*   linini() allocates memory for the crpix, pc, and cdelt arrays in the
*   linprm struct.  It is provided as a service routine; usage is optional,
*   and the caller is at liberty to set these pointers independently.
*
*   If the pc matrix is not unity, linset() also allocates memory for the
*   piximg and imgpix arrays.  The caller must not modify these.
*
*   linini() maintains a record of memory it has allocated and this is used
*   by linfree() which linini() uses to free any memory that it may have
*   allocated on a previous invokation.  Thus it is not necessary for the
*   caller to invoke linfree() separately.  Likewise, linset() deallocates
*   memory that it may have allocated on a previous invokation.
*
*   However, a memory leak will result if a linprm struct goes out of scope
*   before the memory has been free'd, either by linfree() or otherwise.
*   Likewise, if the linprm struct itself has been malloc'd and the allocated
*   memory is not free'd when the memory for the struct is free'd.  A leak may
*   also arise if the caller interferes with the array pointers in the
*   "private" part of the linprm struct.
*
*   Beware of making a shallow copy of a linprm struct by assignment; any
*   changes made to allocated memory in one would be reflected in the other,
*   and if the memory allocated for one was free'd the other would reference
*   unallocated memory.  Use lincpy() instead to make a deep copy.
*
*
*   Status return values
*   --------------------
*   Error messages to match the status value returned from each function are
*   encoded in the lin_errmsg character array.
