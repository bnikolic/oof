*   (WCS) standard.  Refer to

*
*
*   Summary of routines
*   -------------------
*   These routines implement the part of the FITS World Coordinate System
*   (WCS) standard that deals with celestial coordinates.  They define
*   methods to be used for computing celestial world coordinates from
*   intermediate world coordinates (a linear transformation of image pixel
*   coordinates), and vice versa.  They are based on the celprm struct,
*   described in detail below, which contains all information needed for the
*   computations.  It contains some elements that must be set by the caller,
*   and others that are maintained by these routines, somewhat like a C++
*   class but with no encapsulation.
*
*   A service routine, celini(), is provided to initialize the celprm struct
*   with default values, and another, celprt(), to print its contents.
*
*   A setup routine, celset(), computes intermediate values in the celprm
*   struct from parameters in it that were supplied by the caller.  The
*   struct always needs to be set up by celset() but it need not be called
*   explicitly - see the explanation of cel.flag below.
*
*   celx2s() and cels2x() implement the WCS celestial coordinate
*   transformations.  In fact, they are high level driver routines for the
*   lower level spherical coordinate rotation and projection routines
*   described in sph.h and prj.h.
*
*
*   Default constructor for the celprm struct; celini()
*   ---------------------------------------------------
*   celini() sets all members of a celprm struct to default values.
*
*   Returned:
*      cel      struct celprm*
*                        Celestial transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null celprm pointer passed.
*
*
*   Print routine for the celprm struct; celprt()
*   ---------------------------------------------
*   celprt() prints the contents of a celprm struct.
*
*   Given:
*      cel      const struct celprm*
*                        Celestial transformation parameters (see below).

*                           1: Null celprm pointer passed.
*
*
*   Setup routine; celset()
*   -----------------------
*   celset() sets up a celprm struct according to information supplied within
*   it (see "Celestial transformation parameters" below).
*
*   Note that this routine need not be called directly; it will be invoked by
*   celx2s() and cels2x() if the "flag" struct member is anything other than a
*   predefined magic value.
*
*   Given and returned:
*      cel      struct celprm*
*                        Celestial transformation parameters (see below).
*
*   Function return value:
*               int      Status return value:
*                           0: Success.
*                           1: Null celprm pointer passed.

*                              parameters.

*   celestial coordinates (lng,lat).

*                              invalid, as indicated by the stat vector.
*
*
*   Celestial transformation parameters
*   -----------------------------------
*   The celprm struct consists of the following elements that must be
*   supplied:
*
*      int flag
*         This flag must be set to zero whenever any of the following celprm
*         structure members are set or changed: prj.code, prj.r0, prj.pv[],
*         prj.phi0, prj.theta0, ref[4], phi0, theta0, offset.  This signals
*         the initialization routine, celset(), to recompute intermediaries.
*
*      int offset
*         If true, an offset will be applied to (x,y) to force (x,y) = (0,0)
*         at the fiducial point.
*
*      double phi0, theta0
*         The native longitude and latitude of the fiducial point, i.e. the
*         point whose celestial coordinates are given in ref[1:2].  If
*         undefined (set to a magic value by prjini()) the initialization
*         routine, celset(), will set this to a projection-specific default.
*
*      double ref[4]
*         The first pair of values should be set to the celestial longitude
*         and latitude (usually right ascension and declination) of the
*         fiducial point.  These are given by the CRVALia keywords in FITS.
*
*         The second pair of values are the native longitude and latitude of
*         the celestial pole (the latter is the same as the celestial latitude
*         of the native pole) and correspond to the FITS keywords LONPOLEa and
*         LATPOLEa.
*
*         LONPOLEa defaults to 0 degrees if the celestial latitude of the
*         fiducial point of the projection is greater than the native
*         latitude, otherwise 180 degrees.  (This is the condition for the
*         celestial latitude to increase in the same direction as the native
*         latitude at the fiducial point.)  ref[2] may be set to 999.0 to
*         indicate that the correct default should be substituted.
*
*         In some circumstances the celestial latitude of the native pole may
*         be determined by the first three values only to within a sign and
*         LATPOLEa is used to choose between the two solutions.  LATPOLEa is
*         set in ref[3] and the solution closest to this value is used to
*         reset ref[3].  It is therefore legitimate, for example, to set
*         ref[3] to 999.0 to choose the more northerly solution - the default
*         if the LATPOLEa card is omitted from the FITS header.  For the
*         special case where the fiducial point of the projection is at native
*         latitude zero, its celestial latitude is zero, and LONPOLEa = +/- 90
*         then the celestial latitude of the native pole is not determined by
*         the first three reference values and LATPOLEa specifies it
*         completely.
*
*      struct prjprm prj
*         Projection parameters described in the prologue to prj.h.
*
*   The remaining members of the celprm struct are maintained by celset() and
*   must not be modified elsewhere:
*
*      double euler[5]
*         Euler angles and associated intermediaries derived from the
*         coordinate reference values.  The first three values are the Z-, X-,
*         and Z'-Euler angles, and the remaining two are the cosine and sine
*         of the X-Euler angle.
*
*      int isolat
*         True if the spherical rotation preserves the magnitude of the
*         latitude, which occurs iff the axes of the native and celestial
*         coordinates are coincident.  It flags the opportunity to cache
*         intermediate calculations common to all elements in a vector
*         computation.
*
*
*   Vector lengths
*   --------------
*   Vector computations provide an opportunity for caching intermediate
*   calculations and this may result in a much greater speedup than simple
*   amortisation of the function call overhead.  Accordingly, the
*   transformation routines are matrix-oriented with input coordinate pairs
*   specified via pairs of vectors (one-dimensional C arrays).
*
*   The following diagram describes the situation for cels2x() with nlng = 3,
*   and nlat = 3:
*
*                 lng[0]   lng[1]   lng[2]
*                 ------   ------   ------
*      lat[0]  |  x,y[0]   x,y[1]   x,y[2]
*      lat[1]  |  x,y[3]   x,y[4]   x,y[5]
*      lat[2]  |  x,y[6]   x,y[7]   x,y[8]
*
*   In this case the world-to-pixel routine would calculate nlng * nlat = 9
*   (x,y) coordinate pairs.  It is the responsibility of the caller to ensure
*   that sufficient space has been allocated in the x[] and y[] arrays.
*
*   Vector computation will often be required where neither lng nor lat is
*   constant.  This is accomplished by setting nlat = 0 which is interpreted
*   to mean nlat = nlng but only the matrix diagonal is to be computed.  Thus,
*   for nlng = 3 and nlat = 0 only three (x,y) coordinate pairs are
*   computed:
*
*                 lng[0]   lng[1]   lng[2]
*                 ------   ------   ------
*      lat[0]  |  x,y[0]
*      lat[1]  |           x,y[1]
*      lat[2]  |                    x,y[2]
*
*   Note how this differs from nlng = 3, nlat = 1:
*
*                 lng[0]   lng[1]   lng[2]
*                 ------   ------   ------
*      lat[0]  |  x,y[0]   x,y[1]   x,y[2]
*
*   The situation for celx2s() is similar; the x-coordinate (like lng) varies
*   fastest.
*
*
*   Vector strides
*   --------------
*   The vector stride arguments allow the caller to specify that successive
*   elements of a vector are not contiguous in memory.  This applies equally
*   to vectors given to, or returned from a function.  As a simple example
*   consider the following two arrangements in memory of the elements of four
*   (x,y) coordinate pairs together with an unrelated z coordinate element:
*
*      1) x1 x2 x3 x4 y1 y2 y3 y4 z1 z2 z3 z4
*
*      2) x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2 x3 y3 z3 x4 y4 z4
*
*   In (1), the address of x[] is x1, its stride is 1, and length 4.
*           the address of y[] is y1, its stride is 1, and length 4.
*
*   In (2), the address of x[] is x1, its stride is 3, and length 4.
*           the address of y[] is y1, its stride is 3, and length 4.
*
*   The lng[] and lat[] arrays are assumed to have the same vector stride,
*   sll, as are the x[] and y[] arrays, sxy.  However, the intermediate phi[]
*   and theta[] arrays are each assumed to have a stride of 1.
*
*   If the vector length is 1 then the stride is ignored and may be set to 0.
*
*
*   Status return values
*   --------------------
*   Error messages to match the status value returned from each function are
*   encoded in the cel_errmsg character array.
