BNLib README file
=================

Building 
--------

The library is built using the standard autotools "toolchain"; the
generic instructions for how this works are contained in the INSTALL
file.

* Prerequisites
  
  Below is a textual description of the requirements of the
  library. The file configure.ac defines exactly what the automatized
  configuration mechanism looks for
  
  * GSL Version 1.5 or greater. Note that only a warning error will be
    printed if GSL is not found by the configure script! 
  
  * For python bindings only: SWIG version 1.3.31 or newer (1.3.34
    recommended)

* Build process

  Sample build instructions::
 
      export set BNDEST=~/mylibs
      ./configure --prefix=${BNDEST}
      make && make install



Building from "maintainer" distribution
---------------------------------------

It is necessary to call

autoreconf -i

User build (old)
----------------

Use the standard configure script::

   ./configure --prefix=${HOME}/p/bnlib

Or, even better: define prefix as:
export set BNPREFIX=/home/bn204/d/p/bnprog-devel-main

and then 
	
	./configure --prefix=${BNPREFIX}

At MRAO, have to specify swig manually:
	
	./configure --prefix=${BNPREFIX} SWIG=/usr/bin/swig
