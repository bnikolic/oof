This is the documentation for the part of BNLib that can be used to
generate three dimensional fields with statistics consistent with
Kolmogorov hypotheis. This document is an extract from the complete
documentation of BNLib. It is automatically generated from the source
code using Doxygen.

The parts of the code which are designed end-user accessiblitiy are in
the BNLib namespace. The details of the implementation are in the
BNLib::Kolmog namespace. Not all details are documented -- please see
the source code for the definitive story.

The main entry point is the function BNLib::Kolmogorov3D. You should
start with the documentation of this function.
